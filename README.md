# maze-bfs
A small program that visualizes the operation of the BFS algorithm on a randomly generated maze.
You'll see how BFS searches for the exit of a maze.
To run the animation you will probably have to use [a local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server), but you can also run it without sound [here](https://editor.p5js.org/Bart-coding/sketches/nLvK7QHn9). You can generate a new maze by clicking on a current.
